# Hi there, I'm Adam! ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a Computer Science graduate student at Cornell Tech. I graduated from the National University of Singapore (NUS) for my undergrad, where I also did Computer Science. I like learning and building stuff related to distributed systems and collaborative editing.

## Currently...

-   I'm working in a team of 5 students, under the guidance of advisors from [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/), to solve problems in the B2B SaaS industry.
-   I'm having a blast in New York City!

## Previously...

-   I interned as a software engineer in Singapore at [Sea](https://www.sea.com/), [Traverse (YC S19)](https://www.traverse.ai/), and [CSIT](https://www.csit.gov.sg/), where I did front-end and full-stack web development.
-   I developed, together with [three](https://github.com/lyskevin/) [amazing](https://github.com/chrisgzf) [people](https://github.com/eksinyue), a mental wellness [application](https://www.artpreciate.sg/) that combined art and meditation to directly benefit the hospital staff and patients in Singapore during the pandemic, working in collaboration with the Singapore Art Museum, National Gallery of Singapore, and SingHealth.
-   I was a teaching assistant for several courses at NUS, such as: CS3217 Software Engineering on Modern Application Platforms, CS3244 Machine Learning, CS2040S Data Structures and Algorithms, CS2103 Software Engineering, CS1101S Programming Methodology.

## In my free time...

-   I design websites for fun in Figma (and sometimes develop them).
-   I learn and practice playing all kinds of songs on the kalimba.
-   I play Genshin Impact! I'm in love with the game's soundtrack.
