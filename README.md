# Hi there, I'm Adam! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a CS grad student at Cornell Tech in NYC. Before, I was at the National University of Singapore (NUS) for my undergrad. I like doing full-stack development and learning about blockchains, distributed systems, and collaborative editing.

## Currently...

-   I'm building a product in a team of 6, under the mentorship of advisors from [Johnson and Johnson](https://www.jnj.com/).
-   I'm exploring the work in adjacent fields, such as blockchains, privacy, data science, and product management.
-   I'm working on my next personal project.

## Previously...

-   I interned as a software engineer in Singapore at [Sea](https://www.sea.com/), [Traverse (YC S19)](https://www.traverse.ai/), and [CSIT](https://www.csit.gov.sg/), where I did front-end and full-stack web development.
-   I developed, together with [three](https://github.com/lyskevin/) [amazing](https://github.com/chrisgzf) [people](https://github.com/eksinyue), a mental wellness [application](https://www.artpreciate.sg/) that combined art and meditation to directly benefit the hospital staff and patients in Singapore during the pandemic, working in collaboration with the Singapore Art Museum, National Gallery of Singapore, and SingHealth.
-   I was a teaching assistant for the following courses at NUS: CS3217 Software Engineering on Modern Application Platforms, CS3244 Machine Learning, CS2040S Data Structures and Algorithms, CS2103 Software Engineering, CS1101S Programming Methodology.

## In my free time...

-   I design websites for fun in Figma (and sometimes develop them).
-   I learn new songs to play on the kalimba.
-   I cook japanese dishes for my friends and myself!
