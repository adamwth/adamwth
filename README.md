# Hi there, I'm Adam! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer at Meta. My interests lie in the intersection of full-stack development, collaborative editing systems, and distributed systems & microservices. I'm a product-first engineer, meaning I enjoy solving hard problems the closer they are to the user, and am always on the lookout for new technical opportunities to improve the product.

## Previously...

-   I did my Master's in CS at Cornell Tech in NYC.
-   I did my Bachelor's in CS at the National University of Singapore. 
-   I interned as a software engineer in Singapore at [Sea](https://www.sea.com/), [Traverse (YC S19)](https://www.traverse.ai/), and [CSIT](https://www.csit.gov.sg/), where I did front-end and full-stack web development.
