### Hi there, I'm Adam! 👋

I'm currently a Computer Science graduate student at Cornell Tech. I graduated from the National University of Singapore (NUS) for my undergrad, where I also did Computer Science. I like to build things that are aesthetic, useful, and impactful.

## Currently...

-   I'm working in a team of 5, with the guidance of advisors from [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/), to solve problems faced by sales teams in the B2B SaaS industry.
-   I'm having a blast in New York City!

## Previously...

-   I interned at [Sea](https://www.sea.com/), [Traverse](https://www.traverse.ai/), and [CSIT](https://www.csit.gov.sg/), where I worked as a software engineer doing front-end and full-stack web development.
-   I developed, together with [three](https://github.com/lyskevin/) [amazing](https://github.com/chrisgzf) [people](https://github.com/eksinyue), a mental wellness [application](https://www.artpreciate.sg/) that combined art and meditation that directly benefited hospital staff and patients in Singapore during the pandemic, working in collaboration with the Singapore Art Museum, National Gallery of Singapore, and SingHealth.
-   I was a teaching assistant for several courses at NUS, such as: CS3217 Software Engineering on Modern Application Platforms, CS3244 Machine Learning, CS2040S Data Structures and Algorithms, CS2103 Software Engineering, CS1101S Programming Methodology.

## In my free time...

-   I design and develop web apps for fun ideas that I dream up.
-   I play the kalimba (Coldplay songs are my favorite).
-   I enjoy playing Genshin Impact! I'm also in love with the game's soundtrack, and even more so when it's a lofi mix.
